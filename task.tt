Slide 1: Introduction

Title: MongoDB vs SQL
Introduction to NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL databases
Brief overview of their functionalities
Purpose of the presentation: to compare and contrast MongoDB and SQL databases
Slide 2: MongoDB

Title: MongoDB
Overview:
NoSQL database
Document-oriented database
Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents
Key Features:
Schema-less design
Scalability (horizontal scaling)
High performance for unstructured data
Use Cases:
Content management systems
Real-time analytics
Internet of Things (IoT) applications
Slide 3: SQL (Structured Query Language)

Title: SQL
Overview:
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
Organizes data into structured tables with predefined schemas
Uses SQL for querying and managing data
Key Features:
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties
Data integrity through normalization
Well-suited for complex transactions and relationships
Use Cases:
Enterprise applications
Financial systems
Online transaction processing (OLTP)
Slide 4: Comparison

Title: Comparison
Factors:
Data Model:
MongoDB: Document-based (schema-less)
SQL: Table-based (structured schema)
Scalability:
MongoDB: Horizontal scaling (sharding)
SQL: Vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server)
Query Language:
MongoDB: JSON-like queries
SQL: SQL queries (standardized)
Transactions:
MongoDB: Limited support for multi-document transactions
SQL: Full support for transactions (ACID properties)
Flexibility:
MongoDB: Flexible schema, suitable for evolving data structures
SQL: Rigidity due to predefined schema, suitable for maintaining data integrity
Slide 5: Conclusion

Title: Conclusion
Summary:
MongoDB and SQL offer different approaches to database management.
MongoDB provides flexibility and scalability for unstructured data.
SQL offers strong data integrity and support for complex transactions.
Considerations for Choosing:
Consider data structure and scalability requirements.
Evaluate transactional needs and query complexity.
Recommendations:
Choose MongoDB for flexibility and scalability in handling unstructured data.
Choose SQL for maintaining data integrity and handling complex transactions.
